# Alien Invasion game

This is a game I wrote from following chapters 12-14 of Matthes's Python Crash Course book. This program helped me understand a lot of background logic, patterns, compartmentalization, the need for refractoring, and introduced me to Python a great deal. It also exposed me to the pygame library and general game development.
